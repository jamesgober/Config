## Coding Standards

Our library follows strict coding and design principles to maintain high-quality code and performance. Please ensure your contributions adhere to the following guidelines:

&nbsp;

#### **General Guidelines**
- Follow the **[PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)** coding standards for consistent and modern PHP code style.
- Write **clean, maintainable, and efficient** code, with performance and extensibility in mind.
- Use **detailed PHPDoc comments** for all methods, classes, and properties, ensuring clarity for other contributors.

&nbsp;

#### **Design Principles**
We adhere to the following principles to maintain code quality:
1. **S.O.L.I.D Principles**:
   - **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class should have a single purpose.
   - **O**pen/Closed: Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **L**iskov Substitution: Objects should be replaceable by their base types without altering correctness.
   - **I**nterface Segregation: Use specific interfaces rather than forcing a single, general-purpose one.
   - **D**ependency Injection: Prefer constructor injection for dependencies.

&nbsp;

2. **Performance and Efficiency**:
   - Avoid unnecessary loops, function calls, or memory usage.
   - Optimize file parsing and data processing for large configurations.
   - Prioritize reducing overhead in frequently called operations.

&nbsp;

3. **Extensibility and Modularity**:
   - Write reusable components that integrate seamlessly with the existing library.
   - Ensure new features don't introduce breaking changes to public APIs.

#### **Examples**
Hereâ€™s how we expect contributors to approach code design:

&nbsp;

**Do**:
```php
class ConfigLoader
{
    public function loadFile(string $filePath): array
    {
        // Perform validation and return parsed content
    }
}
```

&nbsp;

**Avoid**:
```php
class ConfigLoader
{
    public function load(string $filePath)
    {
        // Process file without returning structured data or validation
    }
}
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Community Guidelines**
Respect all contributors and engage in productive discussions. If disputes arise, maintain professionalism.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Happy coding, and thank you for your support!
