    <b>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</b>
</h1>

&nbsp;


## Core Principles

1. **Performance-Driven Development**
   - Every component is optimized for speed and low overhead.
   - Benchmarks are used to ensure consistent performance under high-load scenarios.

&nbsp;

2. **Efficiency**
   - Memory usage is minimized by avoiding unnecessary overhead.
   - Parsers are designed to handle large configuration files without sacrificing speed.

&nbsp;

3. **S.O.L.I.D Design**
   - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class has a focused responsibility, ensuring maintainability.
   - **O**pen/Closed Principle: The library can be extended without modifying core functionality.
   - **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Parsers and core classes maintain interoperability.
   - **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clean and concise interfaces for specific functionalities.
   - **D**ependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules are not tightly coupled to low-level implementations.

&nbsp;

4. **Modularity**
   - The library is structured into self-contained components, making it easier to extend and maintain.

&nbsp;

5. **Error Resilience**
   - Custom exceptions provide actionable error messages.
   - Robust handling of malformed configuration files prevents library crashes.

&nbsp;
